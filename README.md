## Background and Overview
As an enthusiastic student of App Academy, I embarked on an ambitious journey to create a comprehensive full-stack application from scratch. The task ahead was challenging: conceptualizing, designing, and deploying an end-to-end solution, all within a short span of two weeks. This project served not only as a testament to the rigorous training and skills acquired at App Academy but also as an opportunity to push boundaries and demonstrate rapid application development capabilities. From ideation to execution, every line of code and design choice was made solely by me, ensuring a personal touch and a deep understanding of the project's nuances. The result? Fortrails, a trail discovery platform that aims to be every adventurer's best companion.


## Technologies and Technical Challenges

The technologies I will use in Fortrails:

- Backend: Ruby on Rails
- Frontend: React, Redux
- Database: PostgreSQL, AWS S3
- Authentication: CSRF
- API: Google Map API



## Fortrails Technical Challenges

Creating Fortrails presented a myriad of intricate technical challenges, especially given the range of technologies employed within a condensed timeframe. Below are the salient challenges encountered during development:

### 1. Backend Development with Ruby on Rails:
   - **Integration with Frontend:** Bridging the Rails server with the React frontend through API endpoints and consistent data formats.
   - **Performance:** Optimizing for efficient query handling and request management within the tight development window.

### 2. Frontend with React and Redux:
   - **State Management:** Architecting a Redux store to efficiently handle dynamic data while minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
   - **Component Modularization:** Designing modular React components for consistency across the app without redundancy.

### 3. Database Management with PostgreSQL:
   - **Schema Design:** Crafting an optimal database schema for quick and efficient data storage and retrieval.
   - **Data Integrity:** Upholding data accuracy and consistency when user interactions modify trail information.

### 4. Authentication Using CSRF:
   - **Security:** Guaranteeing user data and request security through accurate token generation, validation, and session management.
   - **User Experience:** Striking a balance between rigorous security protocols and user-friendly interaction.

### 5. Integration with Google Map API:
   - **Map Customization:** Tailoring the Google Map interface to align with the Fortrails aesthetic and user requirements.
   - **Rate Limits & Quotas:** Navigating API limitations by fine-tuning data fetch and render operations.
   - **Location Data Accuracy:** Ensuring precise trail representation on the map based on user contributions.
